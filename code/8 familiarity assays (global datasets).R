		#NOTE: Because neighbours are occassionally censused in the same month but a few days after the 'owner' this code occassionally creates negative familiarity values. For example if the owner census date is May 15, 2001 and the neighbour census date is May 17, 2001, and the first date that both squirrels are observed on neighbouring middens is May 17, 2001 this will lead to a negative familarity value of -2 (May 15, 2001 - May 17, 2001). To avoid these negative familiarity values you can change all negative values to zeros using the code below. This is a rough approximation but appropriate given that our measure of familiarity is also an approximation (i.e. familiarity is only updated twice per year).
